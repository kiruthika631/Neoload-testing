# Neoload-testing
Real time testing of vtop website
Neoload is a low-priced high-efficiency load and 
stress testing tool that is used to measure the performance of 
web and mobile applications. 
It provides testers and developers automatic test design and 
maintenance, the most realistic simulation of user behavior, 
fast root cause analysis and built-in integrations with the 
entire software development lifecycle toolchain. 
NeoLoad works by simulating traffic (up to millions of users) 
to determine application performance under load, analyze 
response times and pinpoint the number of the simultaneous 
users which the Internet, intranet or mobile application can 
handle. Tests can be performed from inside the firewall (in- 
house) or from the cloud.
