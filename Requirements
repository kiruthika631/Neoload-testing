SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 

1) This software supports the following 
operating systems: 
➢ Windows Vista 
➢ Windows 7 (x86 and x64) 
➢ Windows 8.X (x86 and x64) 
➢ Windows 10 
➢ Windows Server 2008 (x64) 
➢ Windows Server 2012 (x64) 
➢ Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64) 
➢ Linux x86-x64 
➢ (Kernel 2.6 and 3.0.x) tested on 
Debian 6 and 7 
➢ CentOS 5.6, 6.4 and 7 
➢ Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 and 14, 
RedHat 7 
➢ OpenSuse 13

2) NeoLoad software is compatible with all 
known web servers and web applications: 
SOAP, ASP, AJAX, PHP, J2EE, CGI and 
other. 

3) As this utility was written on the Java 
programming language, the NeoLoad web 
product can function on any platform that is 
able to support Java Virtual Machine 7 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: 

➢ If you want to begin using the NeoLoad you 
need to have at least 500Мb empty space on 
a disc. 
➢ Tests results will take additional space on the 
disk. For the installation of the load 
generator or the monitoring agent, you need 
to have 300 Мb free space. 
➢ Additional requirements to hardware 
supplying completely depend on specific 
features of scenario creation. The more load 
is on a server, the more hardware resources 
are required. During testing, you can easily 
control the usage of the processor and 
generator memory. 
➢ If the processor constantly displays more 
than 90%, you need to think about lowering 
6 | P a g e 
the number of virtual customers or raising 
the time of response while a user goes from 
one web page to another. NeoLoad 
developers recommend installing auxiliary 
load generators for better performance 
testing services of the whole system. 
➢ In conclusion, we can say that NeoLoad, the 
urgent facility of load testing, allows to take 
into account all features of modern web 
applications, as well as to test qualitatively 
the developed utilities and projects even with 
limited budgets, having enough time for 
testing. 
➢ NeoLoad is a perfect product of corporate 
and individual class which excellently 
executes different tasks, allowing to reach a 
necessary result in the shortest terms. 
➢ A minimum of 1024 MB system memory is 
recommended.
